Creating a New Model
Creating a new model is as simple as running the make create-new-model command. The pipeline will:

Ask for a pipeline name
Create a new directory for the model with a sanitized name
Copy essential files and templates
Initialize environment variables from prod.env
Generate a new Makefile for the model
4. Building, Testing, and Running the Model
To build, test, and run the model, you can use the Makefile commands provided by the pipeline:

make build: Builds the pipeline and generates the final YAML configuration
make test: Checks the syntax of all Python files
make create-pipeline-run: Runs the pipeline with default pipeline file and parameter values
6. Benefits of Our CI/CD Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline offers several benefits:

Streamlined model creation with easy-to-use commands
Automated building and testing, ensuring code quality
Simplified deployment process
Improved collaboration among team members
Faster delivery of new models and features
8. Creating a Branch and Invoking CI/CD Stages
In this section, we will outline how to create a new branch, push changes to that branch, and then invoke the test, build, and deploy stages of our CI/CD pipeline.

8.1 Creating a New Branch
To create a new branch, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have the latest changes from the main branch by running git checkout main and then git pull.
Create a new branch with a descriptive name by running git checkout -b your-branch-name.
8.2 Pushing Changes
Once you have made your changes, commit and push them to your new branch:

Stage the changes you want to commit by running git add file1 file2 ....
Commit the changes with a descriptive message by running git commit -m "Your commit message".
Push the changes to the remote repository by running git push -u origin your-branch-name.
8.3 Invoking Test, Build, and Deploy Stages
With your changes pushed to the remote repository, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically start running the test, build, and deploy stages.

Usage
Setting Up a New Model
To set up a new model, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run the following command:
make create-new-model

Enter a pipeline name when prompted. The name should consist of only alphanumeric characters and spaces.
